* Dotfiles
Here be my personal configurations for various programs on my
Linux machines.

Clone into .dotfiles in your home directory, and use the `stow`
program to manage the files from there.

Once cloned, change into the ~/.dotfiles directory and issue the
following commands to map to the correct locations:

stow git
stow emacs
stow bash
stow kitty

Note that kitty and emacs are configured to use the JetBrains Mono
Nerd font, so this should be installed first. (Use getnf to install).

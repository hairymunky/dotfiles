* Dotfiles
Here be my personal configurations for various programs on my
Linux machines.

Clone into .dotfiles in your home directory, and use the `stow`
program to manage the files from there.

Once cloned, change into the ~/.dotfiles directory and issue the
following commands to map to the correct locations:

#+begin_src bash
git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/hairymunky/dotfiles.git ~/.dotfiles
stow git
stow emacs
stow bash
stow kitty
#+end_src

Note that kitty and emacs are configured to use the JetBrains Mono
Nerd font, so this should be installed first. (Use getnf to install).
